How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps me in listing all the recent changes I have made to the file and all I have to do is go through it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having access to the entire history, you can compare and learn the working of the program

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    - Only finished code that the programmer sees fit is delivered
    - Unimportant versions of the code is not delivered

    Cons:
    - There is a possibility of partial changes getting lost
    - Partial not covering code could be delivered often and this makes collaboration difficult


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Treating multiple files in one version is preferable for coding as it creates a snapshot of the version / working of the code
